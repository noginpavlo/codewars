"""
Write a function that returns the first non-repeating character in a given string. If all characters repeat, return None.

Example:
print(first_non_repeating("aabccdeff"))
# Output: "b" (since "b" is the first character that appears only once)

print(first_non_repeating("aabbcc"))
# Output: None (since all characters repeat)
