O â€” Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
=============================================================================

is about:
=> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.)
should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

It means basically that you should use inheritance when introducind new code
other then changing old functions. Works? Don't touch! => extend.

Build code in the way so that if you add something you don't have to change
existing code!!!

BY THE WAY. These 2 code blocks are not equivalent to each other.
1. The first block has conditional logic that checks what type of animal is that.
2. The second 'correct' block of code just assumes that you need to know the type of
animal in the first place and then just call it.

If you want to see how conditional logic is implemented following OCP check

"""
This way if I want to introduce one more animal type I don't have to add any changes in
original code.
It create NEW class based on an interface and that's it. Not having to untangle old code
to make changes.
