"""
The basic boilerplate that we have when defining attributes is __init__.

Something like this:
--------------------------------
def __init__(self, x, y, â€¦ ):   |
self.x = x                      |
self.y = y                      |
--------------------------------

To make is shorter we can use dataclass form PEP-557.

The thing is that it is used just to avoid the huge boilerplate when a lot of attributes
are defined in __init__.
